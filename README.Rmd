## About
The `dPCRfit` R package allows fitting regression models to gene concentrations
measurements obtained via digital PCR (dPCR). It uses a dPCR-specific likelihood
function that accounts for the statistical properties of dPCR - such as
concentration-dependent measurement error and non-detects. Models can be
specified via a formula similar to the `lm` function.

This package is useful for directly fitting regression models to dPCR
concentration measurements, for example when partition counts are not available.

Information about laboratory parameters (e.g. partition volume or sample
dilution) can be provided as priors. Currently supported are fixed-effect linear
models, with an identity or logarithmic link function. Models are fitted using
stan through the cmdstanr interface.

## Installing the package

The development version of `dPCRfit` can be installed from GitHub as shown below. Please note that the package is still in early development and may be subject to breaking changes. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("adrian-lison/dPCRfit", dependencies = TRUE)
```

`dPCRfit` also requires CmdStan to be installed on your system. This can be done using the `install_cmdstan()` function from `cmdstanr`. If you experience any problems installing CmdStan, see the [cmdstanr vignette](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html) for help. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cmdstanr::check_cmdstan_toolchain()
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan(cores = 2) # use more cores to speed up
```

The stan model used by dPCRfit needs to be compiled for your device. This is only necessary once - after installing or updating the package - and can be done using the `dPCRfit_compile()` function.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
dPCRfit::dPCRfit_compile()
```

If the models are not successfully compiled, please ensure that `cmdstan` is properly set up and try updating it to a newer version using `cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()`. If the problem persists, please run `dPCRfit::dPCRfit_compile(verbose = TRUE)` and post the output in a new issue on GitHub, along with your `cmdstanr::cmdstan_version()`.

## Introduction
This short intro demonstrates how to fit a linear regression model to dPCR data using the `dPCRfit` package.
```{r}
library(dPCRfit) # load the dPCRfit package
library(ggplot2) # load ggplot2 for plotting
```

### Load example data
We load an example dataset with simulated dPCR measurements. The dataset
represents hypothetical measurements of a target gene concentration in samples
with varying biomass.
```{r}
dPCR_data <- dPCR_linear_simulated
```

We can plot the simulated linear relationship between biomass and target gene
concentration.
```{r data_plot}
ggplot(dPCR_data, aes(x=biomass, y=concentration)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Biomass (mg)") + ylab("Target gene concentration [gc/mL]") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Fit a linear model
We can use `dPCRfit` to fit a linear regression model to the simulated
concentration measurements. For this, we must first define a model of the
measurement noise. In our simulated data, we assumed a dPCR assay with the
following parameters:

- total number of partitions: 25'000
- concentration conversion factor (gc per partition for one concentration unit in original sample): 1.73e-5
- pre-PCR coefficient of variation: 10%

The helper function `noise_dPCR()` allows us to specify such a dPCR assay with
suitable parameters:
```{r}
noise_model <- noise_dPCR(
          total_partitions_prior_mu = 25000, total_partitions_prior_sigma = 0, # we know that there are 25000 partitions
          volume_scaled_prior_mu = 1.73e-5, volume_scaled_prior_sigma = 0, # we know the conversion factor
          prePCR_noise_type = "lognormal" # we assume that pre-PCR noise is log-normally distributed
        )
```
Note that in this example, by setting the standard deviation (sigma) of the
priors to 0, we fix the parameters to their true values. In practice, the exact
number of partitions or the conversion factor may be uncertain, which you can
express by providing a prior with positive standard deviation. The exact parameter
value will then be estimated jointly from the data.

Once we have a suitable noise model, we can run `dPCRfit` to fit a linear regression to our data:
```{r, cache = TRUE}
fitted_model <- dPCRfit(
        formula = concentration ~ biomass, # linear regression formula
        data = dPCR_data, # our data
        prior_intercept = c(0,1), # standard normal prior for the intercept
        prior_coefficients = c(0,1), # standard normal prior for the regression coefficient
        measurements = concentration_measurements(
          id_col = "sample_id", # name of the column with the sample id
          replicate_col = "replicate_id", # name of the column with the biological replicate id
          concentration_col = "concentration", # name of the column with the concentration measurements
        ),
        noise = noise_model # the dPCR noise model we defined above
      )
```

## Results
We can inspect our fitted model using the `summary()` function.
```{r}
summary(fitted_model)
```
Let's plot the fitted model against the data.
```{r model_fit_plot}
model_prediction <- predict(
  fitted_model,
  newdata = data.frame(biomass = seq(0,30)),
  interval = "confidence",
  keep_data = TRUE
  )

ggplot(dPCR_data, aes(x=biomass)) +
  geom_point(aes(y=concentration)) +
  geom_line(data = model_prediction, aes(x = biomass, y = mean), color = "blue") +
  geom_ribbon(data = model_prediction, aes(x = biomass, ymin = q5, ymax = q95), fill = "blue", alpha = 0.3) +
  xlab("Biomass (mg)") + ylab("Target gene concentration [gc/mL]") +
  theme_bw()
```

We can also print the fitted coefficients with 95% credible intervals. The dashed line shows the simulated ground truth.
```{r effects_plot}
ggplot(fitted_model$coef_summary) +
  geom_point(aes(y = variable, x = median)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(y = variable, xmin = q5, xmax = q95), width = 0.2) +
  geom_vline(data = data.frame(variable = c("(Intercept)", "biomass"), true = c(0.2, 0.6)), aes(xintercept = true), linetype = "dashed") +
  ylab("Coefficient") + xlab("Estimate") + facet_wrap(~variable, scales = "free", ncol = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.2, 0.2)) +
  theme_bw()
```
We see that the intercept was estimated with large uncertainty, due to the
increased noise at low concentrations. In contrast, the slope of the linear
relationship with biomass was estimated very precisely.
