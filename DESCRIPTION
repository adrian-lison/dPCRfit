Description: dPCRfit is an R package for fitting regression models to gene
 concentrations measurements obtained via digital PCR (dPCR). The models use a
 dPCR-specific likelihood function that accounts for the statistical properties 
 of dPCR such as concentration-dependent measurement error and non-detects.
    This package is useful for directly fitting regression models to dPCR 
 concentration measurements, for example when the PCR partition counts are not 
 available. Information about laboratory parameters such as the partition volume
 or dilution of the sample can be provided as priors to the models.
    Models can be specified via a formula similar to the `lm` function. The 
 package currently supports fixed-effect multiple linear regression, with an 
 identity or logarithmic link function. Models are fitted using stan through 
 the `cmdstanr` interface.
